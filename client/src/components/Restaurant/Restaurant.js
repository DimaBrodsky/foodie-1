As it really has upset me that both the service and the management last Monday were a huge disappointment. Working around the corner, Pizza East has been the base for many meetings, staff training and celebrations. Therefore, when a close friend was leaving the country for good, we thought Pizza East would make the perfect send-off location. We couldnâ€™t have been more wrong. Firstly, the waitress had terrible attitude, unapproachable and considering we were a group of adults celebrating she was not the person to be our host. Secondly, we specifically chose to dine on a Monday at Pizza East to receive the 50% off, using the Pizza East keyring. However, because we were a group of 9 rather than a group of 8 they would not honour that, even though we never knew this was an issue. You would assume that management would be able to make an executive decision and keep 9 happy customers, rather than having a black cloud of dissatisfaction post meal. Otherwise, we would have made a booking on another day of the week outside of the discount day. However, now we know not to return to Pizza East, as there is no customer loyalty in this restaurant or any form of understanding. Which has forced me to write a review, as I feel it is necessary for them to understand that having a customer who has been to your restaurant for years, is shocked by the service and communication we received on Monday. Luckily Pizza Pilgrims has opened seconds down the road." }, { "rating": 5, "time": "2 weeks ago", "text": "Totally delicious food and drinks, efficient and attentive service.
